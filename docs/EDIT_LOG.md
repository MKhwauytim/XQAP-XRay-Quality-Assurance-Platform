# EDIT_LOG.md

Version history for the XQAP codebase. Every code edit must be logged here before it is applied.

## v1.0 — 2026-06-23 — Initial full codebase commit

First push of the complete XQAP v1 application to GitHub. Covers all phases:
population import, stratified sampling, distribution, employee workspace,
template builder, reports, archive, backups, user management, and settings.

No before/after diff — this is the baseline from which all future edits are measured.

## v2 — 2026-06-23 — Full-audit remediation + 7-day persistent login

Applies the findings of the codebase audit (all except C3 login-throttling, descoped by
the user) and adds session persistence. Highlights: rotated the bootstrap admin passcode to
a strong value with a freshly generated Argon2id hash; sessions now persist for 7 days;
`safeWriteJson` stages writes through a verified `.tmp`; optimistic-concurrency hash now
matches the bytes on disk; legacy password hashes upgrade transparently on login.

**File:** `src/auth/authConfig.ts`

**Before:**
```ts
export const LOGIN_SYSTEM_VERSION = "1.2.0";
...
export const BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH: PasswordHashRecord = {
  algorithm: "argon2id",
  encoded: "$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$Q0EXc66ZzrZ7R+3ZeFyg/w$hr4m5BK1wKMt5JwvYnSVyGZqHKC95FbPsoR9nVsoUIo"
};
```

**After:**
```ts
export const LOGIN_SYSTEM_VERSION = "1.3.0";
...
// Rotated 2026-06-23: strong passcode, Argon2id (m=19456,t=2,p=1). See docs/EDIT_LOG.md v2.
export const BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH: PasswordHashRecord = {
  algorithm: "argon2id",
  encoded: "$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$ptZbFeX582X4+1WJnQ53bw$xyPiz56XTjHm+9hpNiv1efZfLJGPMNZYW3mIT/7D3lI"
};
```

**File:** `src/auth/authSession.ts`

**Before:** session stored in `sessionStorage`, no expiry.

**After:** session stored in `localStorage` with a 7-day TTL derived from `loginAt`; `readSession()`
clears and rejects expired/invalid sessions.

**File:** `src/auth/AuthGate.tsx`

**Before:** `getRoleLabel` had no `guest` branch (guests saw "الموظف"); successful logins never
upgraded legacy password hashes.

**After:** added a `guest` → "ضيف" branch; after a successful managed-user login, if
`needsRehash(user.passwordHash)` the hash is recomputed and persisted (M3).

**File:** `src/auth/passwordCrypto.ts` / `userManagement.ts` — added `persistUserPasswordHash`
helper used by the login rehash path; `createUserId` now uses `crypto.randomUUID()` when available.

**File:** `src/data/storage/safeWrite.ts`

**Before:** wrote the live file in place after snapshotting `.bak`; lock keyed by bare filename.

**After:** stages serialized content to `${fileName}.tmp`, verifies it, then commits to the live
file and removes the tmp; rolls back from `.bak` on failure (M1). Lock now keyed by
`${dir.name}/${fileName}` (L4).

**File:** `src/data/storage/fileSystemAccess.ts`

**Before:** `newHash` hashed `JSON.stringify(preparedFile, null, 2)` (no trailing newline),
mismatching `readJsonFile` which hashes the raw on-disk text (with the `\n` safeWrite appends).

**After:** `newHash` hashes the exact written bytes (`...+"\n"`) so it round-trips as the next
`baseHash` (M2); `createId` uses `crypto.randomUUID()` when available (L5).

**File:** `src/data/distribution/distributionLog.ts` — `createEventId` uses `crypto.randomUUID()`
when available (L5); clarified `computeDaysRemainingForDeadline` documentation (L7).

**File:** `src/data/answers/answerStorage.ts` — `answerFileName` strips path-dangerous characters
from the username before building the filename (M4).

**File:** `src/App.tsx` — `<TestPanel />` now only renders under `import.meta.env.DEV` (L2).

**File:** `CLAUDE.md` — corrected the role list (5 roles incl. `manager`), corrected the
`safeWrite` description, and added a "Security model (advisory-only)" note (C2, L3).
